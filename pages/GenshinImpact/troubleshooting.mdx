To fix this, you must download the [patched UserAssembly](https://drive.yuuki.me/api/public/dl/ZOrLF1E5/GenshinImpact/Data/PC/3.2.0/Global/Patch/UserAssembly-patched.dll).

Rename the original UserAssembly.dll file to UserAssembly.dll.bak and put in the patched one.

Rename the patched UserAssembly from "UserAssembly-patched.dll" to "UserAssembly.dll"
